# Ishika Token Solidity Contract

The Ishika Token Solidity Contract is a smart contract written in Solidity, designed to facilitate the creation and management of the Ishika (IK) token. This README provides an overview of the purpose and functionality of the Ember Token Contract.

## Description

The Ishika Token Contract enables the creation of the Ishika token.
The contract consists of the following key components:

### Token Details: 
The contract stores the details of the Ishika token, including its name, abbreviation, and total supply. These details can be accessed publicly.

### Address Balances: 
The contract maintains a mapping of addresses to token balances, allowing for easy tracking of token ownership and balance for each address.

### Minting Tokens: 
The contract provides a mint function that enables the creation of new Ember tokens. It takes an address and a value as parameters and increases the total supply by the specified amount. The balance of the recipient address is also increased accordingly.

### Burning Tokens: 
The contract includes a burn function to remove Ishika tokens from circulation. It takes an address and a value as parameters and deducts the specified amount from both the total supply and the balance of the address. It includes conditionals to ensure that the address has a sufficient balance before executing the burn operation. I have used require function for checking the requirements like burning amount should always less than available balance.


## Getting Started

To interact with the Ishika Token Contract, follow these steps:

1.Set up an Ethereum development environment, such as Remix, an online Solidity IDE.

2.Create a new file and save it with a .sol extension (e.g., Project.sol).

3.Copy and paste the provided Ishika Token Contract code into the file.

4.Compile the contract by selecting the appropriate compiler version (e.g., pragma solidity 0.8.18) and clicking the "Compile" button.

5.Deploy the contract by selecting the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab, choosing the EmberToken contract from the dropdown menu, and clicking the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mint and burn functions, providing the necessary parameters. Ensure that you have the required Ether balance to cover the gas fees for executing the transactions.
